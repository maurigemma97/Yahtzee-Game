# Yahtzee-Game



The game consists of two files: yahtzee.cpp & yahtzee_utils.cpp. "yahtzee.cpp" is
the main file and "yahtzee_utils.cpp" consists of the game logic. We have divided
the game into four classes: Die, Dice, Scorecard, and Game. Each class performs
largely as the name suggests, where culminates all the necessary logic.
We have tested the code on Ubuntu Linux using a recent version of the GNU C++
compiler, g++. To compile:

g++ -o yahtzee yahtzee.cpp ./yahtzee
